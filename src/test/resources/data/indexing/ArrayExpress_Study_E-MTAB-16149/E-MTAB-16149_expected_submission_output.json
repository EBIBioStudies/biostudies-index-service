  "content": "E-MTAB-16149 Gene expression profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under high light and/or low temperature for 24 h transcription profiling by array EFO EFO_0002768 Arabidopsis thaliana 10-day-old Arabidopsis (Col-0) seedlings were grown on germination medium 20 supplemented with 0.8% Bactoagar and 1% (w/v) sucrose under continuous white light (6 Wm-2 = 30 umol m-2s-1) at 22oC. The seedlings were subjected to high light treatment (50 Wm-2 = 250 umol m-2s-1), cold treatments (4oC) under continuous white light  or both for 24 h. Each treatment had three biological replicates. The data sets were normalized and filtered for quality control with GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies) using the default settings. P-MTAB-159602 sample collection protocol EFO_0005518 Samples were collected in 2.0 mL master tubes (Bio Medical Science) and immediately frozen in liquid N2, and then crushed into powders with zirconium dioxide beads using a vertical shaker (ShakeMaster Neo Ver. 1.0, Bio Medical Science). Ground samples were stored at -80°C until extraction. P-MTAB-159603 growth protocol EFO_0003789 Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) were grown on germination medium 20 supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) Bactoagar and 1% (w/v) sucrose under continuous white light (6 Wm^-2 = 30 umol m^-2s^-1) at 22°C for 10 days. P-MTAB-159604 nucleic acid extraction protocol EFO_0002944 Total RNA was extracted according to previous report (Suzuki et al., 2004, BioTechniques, 37, 542-544). P-MTAB-159605 nucleic acid labeling protocol EFO_0003813 Laveling was perfomed the Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit one-color (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled probes were purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). P-MTAB-159606 nucleic acid hybridization to array protocol EFO_0003815 Hybridization was performed by Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacture's protocol. P-MTAB-159607 array scanning and feature extraction protocol EFO_0003814 Scanning was performed using an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA, Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan) with Agilent Scan Control Software. Signal intensities were extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software with default settings. P-MTAB-159608 treatment protocol EFO_0003969 Seedlings were subjected to the following stress treatments for 24 h: 1. High light (HL): white light at 50 W m^-2 (250 μmol m^-2 s^-1). 2. Cold (Cold): 4°C in a growth chamber (MIR-154-PJ, PHCbi, Tokyo) under continuous white light at 6 W m^-2. 3. High light + Cold (HL + Cold): 4°C in the same growth chamber as Cold treatment, under continuous white light at 50 W m^-2. Each treatment was performed with three biological replicates. P-MTAB-159609 normalization data transformation protocol EFO_0003816 The independent datasets were normalized with GeneSpring(Agilent Technologies). Filtering microarray data for quality control was carried out using the default settings of GeneSpring to remove “Compromised” and thus not Uniform spots, saturated spots, and population outliner.
