  "content": "E-MTAB-9697 RRBP1 rewires Cisplatin resistance in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma by regulating YAP-1 Cell line - High-throughput sequencing RNA-seq of coding RNA EFO EFO_0003738 Homo sapiens The RNA-seq library preparation was performed on H357 CisS at 0 month,H357 CisR at 4 months, and H357 CisR at 8 months whereas CisR represent Cisplatin drug resistance and CisS denote sensitive to Cisplatin.  Additional, we also performed gene specific knockdown on H357CisR 8 months RRPB1 Sh. In experiment, We have added two independent biological replicates of each samples to understand the role of  causative factor for  cisplatin resistance at transcriptomic level. Total RNA isolated from above mentions experiment and  2 μg of  RNA was used to prepared library.  The mRNA was isolated through magnetic beads using mRNA isolation kit (PolyA mRNA isolation Module, NEB) followed by RNA-seq library preparation using mRNA library preparation kit (NEB) strictly following the vendor recommended protocol. After library preparation concentration of libraries was estimated using qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen) and the recommended fragmentation sizes were confirmed by Tapestation (Agilent). P-MTAB-102273 nucleic acid sequencing protocol EFO_0004170 After library preparation concentration of libraries were estimated using Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen) and the recommended fragmentation sizes were confirmed by Tapestation (Agilent) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550. NextSeq 550 P-MTAB-102272 nucleic acid library construction protocol EFO_0004184 For RNA-seq library preparation 2 μg of total RNA was used to isolate mRNA through magnetic beads using mRNA isolation kit (PolyA mRNA isolation Module, NEB) followed by RNA-seq library preparation using mRNA library preparation kit (NEB) strictly following the vendor recommended protocol. P-MTAB-102271 nucleic acid extraction protocol EFO_0002944 The cells preserved in LBP lysis buffer were first taken out from -80°C and thawed by placing the plates/tubes on ice. Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was estimated by Nanodrop (Thermo) and then 2ug of total RNA was used to prepare library. P-MTAB-102270 sample collection protocol EFO_0005518 The RNA-seq library preparation was performed for H357 CisR Nt Sh and H357 CisR CMTM6 shRNA treated with vehicle control (UT) and cisplatin (10 μM) (CisT) for 24 h.
