Acetate has long been regarded as a toxic by-product, known to divert carbon away from production pathways, inhibit cellular growth, and reduce productivity. Recent studies suggest that acetate may also have beneficial effects in glucose-grown E. coli, but its potential in bioprocesses remains unexplored. In this study, we systematically investigated acetate’s impact on bioproduction using a kinetic model of glucose and acetate metabolism in E. coli. The model predicts that acetate can enhance bioproduction in glucose-grown E. coli through three mechanisms: (i) by minimizing acetate overflow, thereby reducing carbon loss, (ii) by increasing acetyl-CoA levels, thereby boosting the biosynthetic flux of acetyl-CoA-derived compounds, and (iii) by promoting biomass accumulation, thus improving overall productivity. We experimentally validated the predictions of the model for mevalonate and 3-hydroxypropionate production, where acetate supplementation increased productivity by 117% and 34%, respectively. Our findings provide a valuable framework for optimizing E. coli-based bioprocesses and highlight acetate’s underutilized potential in biotechnology. By leveraging acetate from waste streams as a metabolic booster, this approach could contribute to more sustainable and environmentally friendly bioprocesses.
