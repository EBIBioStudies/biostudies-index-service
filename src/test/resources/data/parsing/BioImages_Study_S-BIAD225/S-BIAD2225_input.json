            "value": "Primary dermal fibroblasts were derived, following collection of normal skin tissue from patients providing informed consent (study approved by the National Research Ethics Service (UK) (14/NS/1073)). Cells were cultured in T25 flasks (Sarstedt) with fibroblast culture media (high glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) and 4 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco)) and maintained at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 until reaching approximately 80-90% confluency. Fibroblasts between passage 8-9 were used to create spheroids using the hanging drop method. After rinsing with PBS (Sigma), cells were incubated for 5-10 minutes at 37 ºC with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma), quenched with media once cell detachment occurred and centrifuged at 1200 rpm, 21 ºC for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in media and cells were counted using a haemocytometer (Neubauer Improved) to produce cell suspensions containing approximately 90,000-100,000 fibroblasts. These suspensions were centrifuged at 1200 rpm, 21 ºC for 5 minutes and cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml hanging drop mixture (750 µl media and 2250 µl methocel stock solution (methylcellulose). Approximately 30 µl aliquots of this mixture were pipetted onto the inner lid of a 10 cm square tissue culture disk (Thermo Scientific) and PBS added to the bottom of the dish to prevent dehydration. Dishes were incubated for 24 hours at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 to enable the formation of 900-1000 cell spheroids with a diameter between 200-300 µm. \n\nCollagen gels were created using a liquid collagen solution consisting of 2 mg/ml rat tail-derived collagen type I (Corning) supplemented with 100 µg/ml fibronectin (EMD Millipore Corp.), 2 mM HEPES (Sigma), 14.5 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.3% w/v NaHCO3 (Sigma) and 10 µg/ml Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester (AF647, Invitrogen) made up in Opti-MEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% v/v FBS. Liquid collagen (prepared on ice) was placed directly onto UV light sterilised 4-well chambered coverslips (ibidi). Rectangular pieces of Mylar plastic film (0.125 mm thickness, Radioshack Pro) were fixed to both ends of individual chamber coverslips with UV curing Norland Optical Adhesive 81 (Norland Products Inc.). Liquid collagen mixture was deposited between the Mylar supports and gels then overlaid with PDMS stamps that were pre-treated with 1% BSA (Roche) made up in PBS. Supports were arranged such that stamping with the PDMS stamps allowed for the formation of micro well-like structures that had a defined distance from the coverslip surface. Gels were left to polymerise at 37 ºC in a sterile tissue culture incubator for approximately 2 hours. The PDMS stamps used a SU-8 2100 (MicroChem) master wafer which had 200 µm diameter micropillars at 950 µm pitch, with the stamps and wafer manufactured as described in https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.240754. PDMS stamps cut to dimensions of approximately 1.5 cm by 1 cm were stored in 70% ethanol at 4 ºC. Prior to use, stamps were irradiated for 30 minutes under UV light and the micropillars coated with 1% BSA for at least 1 hour. Once polymerised, collagen gels were covered with fibroblast culture media. Spheroids were manually pipetted into the microwells; one spheroid was embedded per gel in a central position and samples left to settle for 15 minutes. Samples were incubated at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 for 0-7 days. \n\nIn-gel spheroids were fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma) for 2 hours at 37 ºC after 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours or 7 days incubation, and stored in PBS supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 4 ºC. At room temperature, cells were permeabilised for 15 minutes with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 made up in PBS (PBST, Sigma) then blocked with 5% BSA solution (in PBST) for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed in PBS, then stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33342 (1:250 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) in 5% BSA overnight at 4 ºC, protected from light. Cells were washed in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature and stored in penicillin-streptomycin supplemented PBS at 4 ºC until required for imaging. Although the collagen gel and actin cytoskeleton were fluorescently labelled, only the Hoechst channel was imaged here. ",

CARE learns how to restore images via providing training data comprising pairs of the same field of view imaged at high and low qualities. Models were trained using the CAREamics python library (https://careamics.github.io/0.1/). All models were trained using MAE loss for 100 epochs with a batch size of 4 and a 0.8 validation split. For real images, a patch size of 128 x 128 was used, and for synthetic images a patch size of 64 x 64 was used. \n\nFor all datasets, two models were trained per illumination dose (or noise level, for synthetic data). At each illumination dose, fields of view were split randomly into two groups (along with the maximum illumination dose fields of view, which were used as the ground truth). Each group was augmented with flips and rotations, and then a CARE model trained for each group. The CARE model from the first group of images was used to make predictions for the second group of images, and vice versa, ensuring independence of training data from test data. The training data sizes were: S. pombe – 30 1412 x 1412 pixel images, actin – 30 1412 x 1412 pixel images, spheroid – 33 1412 x 1412 pixel images, HPA synthetic data – 1600 256 x 256 pixel images.

The metrics were evaluated in pairs (one pair being in the loss function at a time) with the value of one being maximised and the other minimised. A simple optimisation loop was run, minimising the loss function, which had a component for each of the metrics (one positive and one negative, so one would maximise and the other minimise), and a component for a blurred version of the image to regularise the optimisation, avoiding the optimisation achieving a strong difference in metric values by, for example, changing the background offset or similar relatively uninteresting properties. The weighting of the two metrics within the loss function was adjusted by hand to achieve the best illustration of the potential differences (and to take into account the different scaling of the metrics). The value of Pearson’s coefficient was squared to improve the stability of the optimisation, and for pixel-by-pixel optimisation, to avoid having the image simply invert.\n\nThe starting images for the actin and mitochondria attacks are provided (labelled as starting_image), as are reference images for both fields of view (labelled as reference).
