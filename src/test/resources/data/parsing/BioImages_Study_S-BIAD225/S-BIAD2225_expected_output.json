Full product details available at https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/F36924. Bovine pulmonary artery epithelial cells 28 laser powers imaged for each field of view.\n3 channels were imaged: 405nm (DAPI), 488nm (phalloidin), 561nm (mitotracker) Mixed samples from the Human Protein Atlas Original data is from the Human Protein Atlas open dataset, with data collection as described in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0658-6 and the original dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/human-protein-atlas-image-classification. Only the green channel of the original images are included here. Human cells stained with a range of antibodies for different subcellular compartments Fixed S. pombe expressing cytoplasmic sfGFP S. pombe was cultured using standard methods on solid (YES agar) and liquid (YES) growth media (ForMedium), at a growth temperature of 32ºC. Following at least 48 hours of growth, cells in exponential growth were fixed by shaking in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cells were pelleted, washed and resuspended in 1 ml PBS. For imaging, 35 mm dishes with uncoated polymer coverslips (Ibidi) were first coated with 1 mg ml-1 soybean lectin (in water, aliquots stored at -70ºC, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. After washing away the excess lectin with fresh YES, fixed cells were allowed to settle for 30 min in 500 µl PBS. The entire plating volume was replaced with fresh PBS prior to imaging. The strain used expressed sfGFP throughout the cell body (h- ura4+:pact1:sfGFP:terminatortdh1 (AV0890); https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.240754) Fixed human dermal fibroblast spheroids stained with Hoechst Primary dermal fibroblasts were derived, following collection of normal skin tissue from patients providing informed consent (study approved by the National Research Ethics Service (UK) (14/NS/1073)). Cells were cultured in T25 flasks (Sarstedt) with fibroblast culture media (high glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma) and 4 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco)) and maintained at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 until reaching approximately 80-90% confluency. Fibroblasts between passage 8-9 were used to create spheroids using the hanging drop method. After rinsing with PBS (Sigma), cells were incubated for 5-10 minutes at 37 ºC with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma), quenched with media once cell detachment occurred and centrifuged at 1200 rpm, 21 ºC for 5 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in media and cells were counted using a haemocytometer (Neubauer Improved) to produce cell suspensions containing approximately 90,000-100,000 fibroblasts. These suspensions were centrifuged at 1200 rpm, 21 ºC for 5 minutes and cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml hanging drop mixture (750 µl media and 2250 µl methocel stock solution (methylcellulose). Approximately 30 µl aliquots of this mixture were pipetted onto the inner lid of a 10 cm square tissue culture disk (Thermo Scientific) and PBS added to the bottom of the dish to prevent dehydration. Dishes were incubated for 24 hours at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 to enable the formation of 900-1000 cell spheroids with a diameter between 200-300 µm. \n\nCollagen gels were created using a liquid collagen solution consisting of 2 mg/ml rat tail-derived collagen type I (Corning) supplemented with 100 µg/ml fibronectin (EMD Millipore Corp.), 2 mM HEPES (Sigma), 14.5 mM NaOH (Sigma), 0.3% w/v NaHCO3 (Sigma) and 10 µg/ml Alexa Fluor 647 NHS Ester (AF647, Invitrogen) made up in Opti-MEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% v/v FBS. Liquid collagen (prepared on ice) was placed directly onto UV light sterilised 4-well chambered coverslips (ibidi). Rectangular pieces of Mylar plastic film (0.125 mm thickness, Radioshack Pro) were fixed to both ends of individual chamber coverslips with UV curing Norland Optical Adhesive 81 (Norland Products Inc.). Liquid collagen mixture was deposited between the Mylar supports and gels then overlaid with PDMS stamps that were pre-treated with 1% BSA (Roche) made up in PBS. Supports were arranged such that stamping with the PDMS stamps allowed for the formation of micro well-like structures that had a defined distance from the coverslip surface. Gels were left to polymerise at 37 ºC in a sterile tissue culture incubator for approximately 2 hours. The PDMS stamps used a SU-8 2100 (MicroChem) master wafer which had 200 µm diameter micropillars at 950 µm pitch, with the stamps and wafer manufactured as described in https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.240754. PDMS stamps cut to dimensions of approximately 1.5 cm by 1 cm were stored in 70% ethanol at 4 ºC. Prior to use, stamps were irradiated for 30 minutes under UV light and the micropillars coated with 1% BSA for at least 1 hour. Once polymerised, collagen gels were covered with fibroblast culture media. Spheroids were manually pipetted into the microwells; one spheroid was embedded per gel in a central position and samples left to settle for 15 minutes. Samples were incubated at 37 ºC and 5% CO2 for 0-7 days. \n\nIn-gel spheroids were fixed in 10% formalin (Sigma) for 2 hours at 37 ºC after 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours or 7 days incubation, and stored in PBS supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 4 ºC. At room temperature, cells were permeabilised for 15 minutes with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 made up in PBS (PBST, Sigma) then blocked with 5% BSA solution (in PBST) for 1 hour. Samples were rinsed in PBS, then stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33342 (1:250 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) in 5% BSA overnight at 4 ºC, protected from light. Cells were washed in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature and stored in penicillin-streptomycin supplemented PBS at 4 ºC until required for imaging. Although the collagen gel and actin cytoskeleton were fluorescently labelled, only the Hoechst channel was imaged here.

Six FOVs were imaged with 50ms exposure, four FOVs were imaged with 100ms exposure.\nFor each FOV, images were acquired at the following laser powers set in the software: 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%. The 561nm channel was imaged first, then the 488nm channel, then the 405nm channel. Noise addition to HPA data Original data acquired on confocal microscopes using 63x oil immersion objective (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0658-6) Reference images are unchanged relative to the original dataset.\nDifferent levels of signal were simulated by dividing original intensities by 2,4,8,12,16, or 20 in the HPA data, and by 2 in the DU145s. Poisson noise and Gaussian noise (σ=5) was then added through the random package in numpy. \nlow_poisson_gaussian = original intensity divided by 2\nmid_poisson_gaussian = original intensity divided by 4\nhigh_poisson_gaussian = original intensity divided by 8\nvhigh_poisson_gaussian = original intensity divided by 12\nxhigh_poisson_gaussian = original intensity divided by 16\nxxhigh_poisson_gaussian = original intensity divided by 20 confocal microscopy Denoising - mean filtering Mean filtering was performed using the uniform_filter function in the ndimage package in scipy, with a patch size of 5. All other parameters were left at the default values. Pixel size: 0.110 µm Denoising - non-local means Non-local means filtering was performed using the denoise_nl_means function in the restoration package in scikit-image. For each image, sigma was estimated using the estimate_sigma function in scikit-image.restoration, and consistently a patch size of 5 and a patch distance of 11 was used. \nPixel size: 0.110 µm Denoising - CARE The AI image restoration network used here was CARE \u200B (content aware image restoration). CARE learns how to restore images via providing training data comprising pairs of the same field of view imaged at high and low qualities. Models were trained using the CAREamics python library (https://careamics.github.io/0.1/). All models were trained using MAE loss for 100 epochs with a batch size of 4 and a 0.8 validation split. For real images, a patch size of 128 x 128 was used, and for synthetic images a patch size of 64 x 64 was used. \n\nFor all datasets, two models were trained per illumination dose (or noise level, for synthetic data). At each illumination dose, fields of view were split randomly into two groups (along with the maximum illumination dose fields of view, which were used as the ground truth). Each group was augmented with flips and rotations, and then a CARE model trained for each group. The CARE model from the first group of images was used to make predictions for the second group of images, and vice versa, ensuring independence of training data from test data. The training data sizes were: S. pombe – 30 1412 x 1412 pixel images, actin – 30 1412 x 1412 pixel images, spheroid – 33 1412 x 1412 pixel images, HPA synthetic data – 1600 256 x 256 pixel images. For the HPA dataset, the CARE models at each noise level included all labels. \n\nPixel size: 0.110 µm On-sample illumination calibration Laser intensities in % can be converted to on-sample power in µW using this following formulae (cubic fit to measured powers for described wavelengths):\n405nm\npower_uW = -0.0002 * power_pc^3 + 0.0489 * power_pc^2 + 1.2197 * power_pc - 7.0276\n\n488nm\npower_uW = -0.0003 * power_pc^3 + 0.0045 * power_pc^2 +21.31 * power_pc -20.924\n\n561nm\npower_uW = -0.0004 * power_pc ^ 3 + 0.0676 * power_pc ^ 2 + 11.156 * power_pc - 24.5 Offline Denoise.AI analysis Nikon Denoise.AI was batch applied offline following image conversion of 8-bit png to 8-bit tiff files (NIS Elements AR 6.02.03). Adversarial attack An adversarial attack was performed on the SSIM, Pearson and PSNR metrics. The metrics were evaluated in pairs (one pair being in the loss function at a time) with the value of one being maximised and the other minimised. A simple optimisation loop was run, minimising the loss function, which had a component for each of the metrics (one positive and one negative, so one would maximise and the other minimise), and a component for a blurred version of the image to regularise the optimisation, avoiding the optimisation achieving a strong difference in metric values by, for example, changing the background offset or similar relatively uninteresting properties. The weighting of the two metrics within the loss function was adjusted by hand to achieve the best illustration of the potential differences (and to take into account the different scaling of the metrics). The value of Pearson’s coefficient was squared to improve the stability of the optimisation, and for pixel-by-pixel optimisation, to avoid having the image simply invert.\n\nThe starting images for the actin and mitochondria attacks are provided (labelled as starting_image), as are reference images for both fields of view (labelled as reference).
